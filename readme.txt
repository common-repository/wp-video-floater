This plugin will allow you to keep your videos playing floating at the bottom of the page as you scroll down.

== Description ==

[WP Video Floater](http://wpgate.com.br) WordPress Plugin allows you to insert a video on the page and, as the user scrolls the page, the video will be pushed to the bottom-right. Works with OptimizePress Embed videos too.

### Key features
- Sell more! Allows your visitor to watch your video and see your content at the same time.
- You don't have to edit source code of your template to insert any code.
- No coding, just 2 easy steps and you'll have an awesome page!

### To use it you'll need to add a class to the iframe that you want to scroll and add the shortcode below to anywhere in the page.

Class to the video: 
`wp-video-floater`

Shortcode to the page:
`[wp-video-floater]`

### Works with OptimizePress. The plugin works nice with OP pages. You'll need to do the same thing above, but also you'll need to add a class to the element.
*There's a settings icon on each element on the top-right, if you click you'll see an "Advanced element options" popup and then you'll be able to add the class below*

Class to the OP element: 
`wp-video-floater`
